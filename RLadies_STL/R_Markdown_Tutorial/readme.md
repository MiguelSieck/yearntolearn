You can access the slides for the presentation [here](https://momiji15.github.io/rladiesstl_rmarkdown/RLadiesSTL_Markdown040220#1).

It is recommended that you do the Unit1 and Unit2 tutorials as opposed to solely relying on the slides. The slides only gives an overview of each concept, while the Unit1 and Unit2 are tutorials that provide specific information on how to do each process.
