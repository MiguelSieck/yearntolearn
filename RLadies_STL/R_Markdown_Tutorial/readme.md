You can access the slides for the presentation [here](https://momiji15.github.io/rladiesstl_rmarkdown/RLadiesSTL_Markdown040220#1).

There are two units for this workshop:

Unit 1: [Creating an R Markdown Document](https://github.com/momiji15/yearntolearn/blob/master/RLadies_STL/R_Markdown_Tutorial/Unit1.md)

Unit 2: [Making a Blogdown Site](https://github.com/momiji15/yearntolearn/blob/master/RLadies_STL/R_Markdown_Tutorial/Unit2.md)

If you have no experience with R Markdown, it is recommended that you do both units. If you do have experience with R Markdown, you can go on to Unit 2.

If you are doing this on your own, it is recommended that you first look at the slides to give you a general idea of R Markdown and follow Unit 1 and Unit 2 to make your website.
