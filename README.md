# Yearn to Learn!

An attempt to add some organization for the R learning resources I created. Here is a list of tutorials that I have made:

1 GAW2019_Making Web Maps With R: This was made for a workshop on 11/14/19 that occursed during Geography Awareness Week at Washington University - St. Louis.

2. R Markdown Tutorial: This tutorial was made for the R-Ladies Athens meeting on 04/26/19.

3. [R Ready to Map Tutorial](https://github.com/momiji15/apptomap/tree/master/R%20Ready%20to%20Map): This course, which teaches how to collect tweets and map them using the rtweet and leaflet packages was made for the Programming for GIS class at the University of Georgia.

4. [App to Map](https://github.com/momiji15/apptomap): This tutorial, which teaches how to collect tweets and map them using the #twitteR package, was made as part of a worksop for the We Rise Conference in Atlanta, GA in June 2017.

I will eventually transfer the R Ready to Map Tutorial and Map to App tutorial to this repo.
