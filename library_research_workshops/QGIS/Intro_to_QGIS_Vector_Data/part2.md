## Unit 1: Basic Cartographic Elements
### Unit Objectives
1. Identify basic cartographic elements of a map.
2. Identify symbolization considerations for symbolizing quantitative data.

Before we get into map making, it's important to understand basic cartographic elements of a map. 


## Unit 2: Symbolizing Layers
### Unit Objectives
1. Selecting an appropriate color scheme for polygon data.
2. Producing a symbology by size for points data.

Terms to Know:
- chloropleth map: A map in which color is used to represent value over a specific area. 

#### Lesson 1: Selecting an Appropriate Color Scheme for Polygon Data
Using what we learned in the previous lesson, lets add some symbolization to our point and polygon data. Let's start first with the polygon data. We are interested in showing the percentage of individuals that has an income to poverty ratio over two. 

1. Right-click on **stl_bg** and click on **Properties**.

2. In the left-hand panel, click on **Symbology**.

3. 

### Unit 3: Creating and Exporting a Map Layout
1. Generate a print layout for a map.
2. Create a map incorporating the basic cartographic elements.
3. Export a map in an appropriate file format.
