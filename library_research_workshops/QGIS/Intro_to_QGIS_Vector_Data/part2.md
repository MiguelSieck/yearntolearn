## Unit 1: Basic Cartographic Elements
### Unit Objectives
1. Identify basic cartographic elements of a map.
2. Identify symbolization considerations for symbolizing quantitative data.

Before we get into map making, it's important to understand basic cartographic elements of a map. 


## Unit 2: Symbolizing Layers
### Unit Objectives
1. Selecting an appropriate color scheme for polygon data.
2. Producing a symbology by size for points data.

### Terms to Know:
- chloropleth map: A map in which color is used to represent value over a specific area. 
- color hue: Refers to different colors, such as blue and green.
- color value: Refers to different shades of one hue such as dark blue and light green. Colors become darker by adding
  black to the hye, and colors become lighter by adding white to the hue.
- color intensity: Also known as saturation. This is the brightness of the color. Adding colors can make the hue less
  intense. For exmaple, adding grey to a hue can make it less intense. If you are having issues differientating value from 
  intensity, you can think of intensity as how different or similar a color is from grey.

#### Lesson 1: Selecting an Appropriate Color Scheme for Polygon Data
Using what we learned in the previous lesson, lets add some symbolization to our point and polygon data. Our final product will be a chloropleth map which shows the relationshop of the student to teacher ratio to the number of individuals in block groups who have an income to poverty ratio over two.  Let's start first with the polygon data. 

1. Right-click on **stl_bg** and click on **Properties**.

2. In the left-hand panel, click on **Symbology**.

3. On the top of the Layer Properties window you will see a drop-down menu in which **Single symbol** is the default. Click on it and choose the **Graduated** option.

4. For **Value**, choose **pct_gt_2** from the drop-down menu.



### Unit 3: Creating and Exporting a Map Layout
1. Generate a print layout for a map.
2. Create a map incorporating the basic cartographic elements.
3. Export a map in an appropriate file format.
