## Unit 1: Introduction to Vector Data
### Unit Objectives
  1. Define Geographic Information Systems (GIS) 
  2. Describe the two types of GIS data.
  3. List three types of GIS vector data.
  4. Describe the structure of GIS data.

### Terms to know
Geographic Information Systems(GIS): A computer system that is used to capture, display, and analyze data that has a spatial reference on Earth.

vector data: GIS data that represents data on the earth through points, lines, and polygons.

raster data: GIS data that represents data on the earth through a grid of pixels.

shapefile: A file format for vector data, which comprises of at least four different file types.

#### GIS, Vector and Raster GIS Data
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is a very powerful tool when it comes to understanding physical and socio-cultural processes on the earth. There are various types of GIS software out there, however a common thread with the software is the data they deal with. GIS uses vector data and raster data to represent features on the earth. Vector data is made up of points, lines and polygons. An example of point data could be a points representing school locations (which you will see in today's workshop). An example of line data could be lines representing rivers and streams. Finally, an example of polygon data could be school districts.

On the other hand, raster data is a grid of pixels in which each value represents a feature on the earth. For example each pixel of a raster image of a forest profile could represent the type of tree in the forest. For today's workshop we will be exclusively focusing on vector data. The GIS software that we will be using today is Quantum GIS, also known as QGIS. QGIS is a very convenient software, for it is available for both Mac and Windows machines and it is free and open source. 

One of the file formats that represent vector data is a shapefile, which is actually made of up of various filetypes such as .shp, .shx, .dbf, and .prj.
